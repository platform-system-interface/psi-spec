## Peripherals

Systems connect with external hardware components, also known as _peripherals_,
using buses and controllers. A controller is a unit driving a bus, such as the
high-speed USB and PCIe buses or the slower SPI and I2C. Hardware platforms may
integrate controllers directly or chain them through adapters and expansions.
